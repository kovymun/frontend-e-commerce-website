## Description and Purpose:

This is a **Frontend Web Development** project developed as an **e-commerce online application / store** for a fictitious company called **THE SPICE PANTRY**. It is a family owned business run by two sisters who have embraced their love for spice.

The application enables customers to **conveniently** purchase spices through the online store while also serving as a **platform to market the brand** of **THE SPICE PANTRY**.

Through a **visually appealing user interface, simple in-app navigation, and informative product descriptions and images**, the application offers a **convenient, seamless, and user-friendly** online shopping experience. **Responsive design** ensures that customers can **conveniently** explore and access the offerings of The Spice Pantry anytime, anywhere. Additionally, it drives **user engagement** through effective social media marketing, newsletter subscriptions, and direct customer communications, fostering relationships, community building, and customer retention.

It is developed using **front-end technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. Additionally styled using both **CSS and Bootstrap V5**, creating a visually appealing user interface.
