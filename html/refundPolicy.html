        <!-- Refund policy details -->
        <h5>Returns:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>14-Day Return Policy:</strong> You have 14 calendar days
            from the date of purchase to return an item for a refund or
            exchange.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Condition of Items:</strong> Returned items must be in good
            condition and reasonably intact, considering the nature of the
            product. While we understand that you may have used a portion of the
            spice, we kindly request that the majority of the product remains
            unused. Additionally, please ensure that the packaging is retained
            in its original state to the best of your ability. This includes
            sealing the packaging securely to prevent spillage or contamination.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proof of Purchase:</strong>To be eligible for a return, you
            must provide a valid proof of purchase, such as a receipt or order
            confirmation email.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refund Process:</strong> Once your return is received and
            inspected, we will send you a notification through your preferred
            contact method regarding the status of your refund. If approved, the
            refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied
            to your original method of payment within 7 days, depending on your
            card issuer's policies.
          </li>
        </ol>
